# Ninjy
I programmed this game over the course of a week. The objective is to collect as many apples as possible, while avoiding the enemies. You can also collect mushroom powerups throughout the game.

# Motivation
I made this game because I love to program! It was also good practice. A lot of the time, I have trouble following through and finishing projects, so I'm proud that I was able to complete this game.

# Tools and Frameworks
I used Javascript and the [Phaser library](https://phaser.io/phaser3), a framework for creating 2d games. In addition, I used the [mathjs library](https://mathjs.org/) to assist in calculating the trigonometry in the game.

# Difficulties
Because this was my first time programming in Javascript, I had to get used to the syntax. Although learning a new language initially slowed me down, I'm glad I did because I have developed somewhat of an understanding of how Javascript works. 

Furthermore, because this was my first time using Phaser, I had trouble learning how to use the framework, in particular the Sprite and Scene classes. While Phaser 3 has documentation, the online resources and tutorials are pretty sparse compared to Phaser 2. 

[This YouTube tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frRWKxB9Hm0) by Luis Zuno :pray: helped me a ton. In the future, I'm going to practice reading documentation so that I can be better equipped in situations where the framework is fairly recent.
